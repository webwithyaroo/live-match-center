## Match Dashboard

The dashboard is implemented as a server component using the App Router.  
Initial implementation focuses on correct data rendering and navigation, deferring real-time updates to a later phase to keep concerns separated.


## Match Detail View

The match detail page fetches full match information including events and statistics.
The implementation is intentionally server-rendered to ensure consistency before layering in real-time updates.
